        Bagan is absolutely magical! The sight of thousands of ancient temples
        scattered across the plains is something I'll never forget. The best
        part of my trip was taking a hot air balloon ride at sunriseâ€”floating
        above the temples with the mist rising was surreal. The locals are
        incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the food is delicious. Bagan is a
        place that feels both timeless and enchanting. Highly recommend!
